  Wireframing is an important step in any screen design process. It primarily allows you to define the information hierarchy of your design, making it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information. If you've yet to use wireframing, it's time to get your feet wet.

We'll run down the nessasery steps to a great start to making a solid clean coded web site.

Here's a great link from @capiutalJ that is recommended for anyone wanting to start this party off right.https://www.sketchapp.com/" that and a good old pencil and sketch pad works as well.

>#Step 1: Getting Inspiration

If ive learned anything from @capitalJ is that an IMG can paint 1000 words, take a look at this link "http://jabaltorres.com/#about" this is the result of wireframing using these steps.
Here's another great example "http://wireframes.tumblr.com/".     
OK now that you'll be able to get a quick overview and visual understanding of how other designers are handling their wireframing process.
If you continually observe what other designers or sites are doing for their wireframes, you will slowly get a picture in your mind of how a wireframe helps to organize information for the screen. 
###Every day life 
can also be a great source inspiration so keep this in mind when mapping out your page.

>#Step 2: Process

You have to find the process that brings out your own strengths and you are most comfortable with. ![example of a diagram showing several typical processes:](

        About this Course

        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that describes the presentation of web pages. Whereas HTML is what forms the structure of a web page, CSS is what we use to style the HTML with colors, backgrounds, font sizes, layout, and more. As you'll soon learn, CSS is one of the core technologies for designing and building websites.

13 steps

       Understanding Values and Units

Every CSS property has a set of values it can accept. Most properties accept keywords that literally describe a value. Many properties also accept numbers, functions, length values, or a URL. In this stage, you'll learn the common values and units CSS properties accept.

14 steps

       The Box Model

About this Course

If you’ve never built a website before and you have no coding or design experience, this is the place to start. In this project, we learn how to build a modern portfolio website for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. We start with basic HTML and CSS syntax. Next, we learn how to build custom web pages with an image gallery and contact page. Finally, we walk through how to share a website live on the web.





THINGS I LEARNED
How to write basic HTML
How to style web pages with CSS
How to purchase a domain and hosting
How to upload files



       Beginning HTML and CSS 

In this quick tutorial, we’ll check out an example of the final web project we’re aiming to build. Then, we’ll learn how to code our first HTML element, which will help form the structure of our website. Finally, we’ll finish up by styling our website with some simple CSS. These two languages, HTML and CSS, form the basic building blocks of any web project.

6 steps


       HTML First

HTML is a special computer language that describes  the structure of a document. With HTML, we can build web pages that contain text, images, and many other types of content. First, we’ll get started with a quick history lesson. Then we’ll dig into the latest advancements in HTML by creating a simple page structure.

7 steps


       Creating HTML Content

When building websites, it's best to write as much of  the HTML structure as possible before moving on to CSS. In practice, you'll move back and forth between HTML and CSS, but building most of the structure first will make it an easier process. First we will start  by creating the navigation for our site. Then, we can move on to structuring the image gallery and other page content. Finally, we'll finish by including a CSS file into our HTML page.

9 steps






       CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is a language that allows us to make designs that are well organized and beautiful. While HTML describes the structure of information, CSS describes how that information should be visually presented. Before we start coding the CSS for our site, we will spend some time learning about the syntax of CSS.

7 steps

          


       Customizing Colors and Fonts

Colors in CSS require a special coded format called hexadecimal. We will first learn about hexadecimal numbers and then we can use them in our color values. Then, we’ll learn how to find licensed fonts as well as how to include fonts in a webpage.

8 steps


       Styling Web Pages and Navigation

The techniques necessary for styling an image gallery as well as horizontal navigation are actually quite similar. First, we will learn how to style a group of images and convert them into rows and columns for our image gallery. Then, we will use a similar CSS technique to create horizontal navigation from an unordered list.

7 steps


       Adding Pages to a Website

When multiple web pages are linked together, the pages become collectively known as a website. The home page will serve as the template for both our contact page and about page. In both pages, we will learn some new CSS techniques.

7 steps


       Responsive Web Design and Testing

Modern websites are built with mobile and desktop users in mind. By building our site with fluid percentages (instead of fixed pixels), we’re off to a good start. However, we can add special CSS rules called media queries to further enhance the experience. After adding responsive design, we will test the site on a few devices.

9 steps


       Sharing a Website

We're finished coding our website and now it's time to deploy it live to the web so that other people can see it. First, we will purchase our domain and hosting. Then, we will use the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to put our files onto our server.

4 steps


       Debugging HTML and CSS Problems

When creating websites, problem solving skills are essential. First, we will learn how to access the developer tools to find problems with our code. Then, we will walk through some common HTML and CSS issues and how to fix them quickly.
