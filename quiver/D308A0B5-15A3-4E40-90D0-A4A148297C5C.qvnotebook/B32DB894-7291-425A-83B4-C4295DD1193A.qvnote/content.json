To succeed in \n                  life one must endure the challenges life presents and work to overcome\n                  hese challenges to be the best possible person that one can be.\n                  We must not only use hard work to impress those around us but also \n                  to achieve goals that we set for ourselves. If we as individuals \n                  do not work hard to succeed, then we do not receive the same \n                  satisfaction as we would if we put in hour upon hour or even year upon\n                  year of work to achieve our goals. I believe for one to be successful,\n                  he must be willing to work hard to succeed in any aspect of life.</p>  \n               <p>What is a hard worker?What qualifies a person to be categorized \n                  as a hard worker? He or She would have to be willing to do the work \n                  and not only do it but do it right. <em>Efficiency?</em> Efficiency \n                  is showing up on time and getting the job done right in a decent amount \n                  of time.A person would have the knowledge to be able to do their work.\n                  Just as the cell is basic for life efficiency is the basic factor of \n                  all hard workers. Efficiency is extremely important it ties in \n                  with the other factors of the hard worker. Bosses look for people who \n                  are efficient people who get the job done the best and fastest way. \n                  Efficiency is not only better and faster but it is also cheaper another\n                  factor of efficiency is tardiness. Tardiness is a big factor in the \n                  work place No matter whom a person works for they will not keep their\n                  job if there is a problem getting to work on time. The one about your\n                  car not starting only works so many times before they say You are \n                  Fired Bottom line is do not be late One morning if the car does not \n                  start the most important thing to do should be to call and tell your\n                  employer what happened Fix it later Just find a ride to work for now. \n                  The second factor in a hard worker is the knowledge base of the person.\n                  Knowledge base is the person right for the job A knowledge base \n                  should not only contain the skills needed to do the job but also some \n                  common sense meaning problem solving skills.               \n               </p>                        \n              <h2>Leadership</h2>\n               <p>Due to its multi-faceted composition and complexity, leadership is a common word that is difficult to describe. In ctuality, leadership can be defined in a variety of way. It is an act of influencing an organized group in their activities for setting goals and reaching achievement. It can also be defined as influence exercised in a particular situation to achieve one or more goals. \n               </p>\n               <p>A leader must possess a variety of qualities. The best leaders understand they don't know everything. Acting as though you know everything while being a leader is a misconception that is very dangerous when it comes to leadership. It is important to gather information from other individuals before making a final decision on an issue. A good leader should gather opinions and views from others in order to broaden their knowledge of a situation. This is important even when the final decision is left up to the person in charge of the group.<br>I AM THIS LEADER.\n               </p>\n            </article>                                        \n               <aside>\n                   <h2><q>Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tommorow is ours to<em>WIN</em> or <em>LOSE</em></q></h2>\n                   <h3><small>By:Lyndon B.
